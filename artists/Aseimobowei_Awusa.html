      <p>Sei Awusa is a Digital Design artist whose work compromises of seeing how we can we incorporate all forms of digital technology around us and embed it into our social life. His work has a strong inclination towards virtual reality and augmented reality (VR/AR) and how these platforms can be used to create a new form of experience affecting our lives both in entertainment or on a more deeper level. His work seems to covers topic such as creativity in identity and all the possibilities both good and bad, that can arise from living a life alongside a virtual world. Sei Awusa has gone and work with the likes of London Transport Museum (LTM) on projects including tracking data of how people in Central London commute around London, depending on different variables including weather, time, events, personal convenience all to improve the big digital map at the centre of the museum.  Sei has also done personal work exploring the idea of Virtual and Augmented Reality called P.I.M ( Primitive Instant Messenger) which was his way of trying to emulate Instant Message softwareâ€™s such as WhatsApp/Skype/Messenger etc. into the real life world, he has done this by placing two interconnected cardboard boxes and their wearers opposite each other with the only form of communication between the two is the simple mechanic of the cup-and-string technique attached at the lower part of each boxes allowing the two to communicate with each other.</p>

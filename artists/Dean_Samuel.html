      <p>Dean Samuel is a hackney born digital artist with a strong interest in movies, games and animations and how they can be considered a form of art. He generally focuses less on the concept and dematerialisation of art, instead he tries to create work he genuinely finds visually pleasing. <br />
The majority of his work questions whether video games can be seen as a form of art, his projects have shifted from being drawing/painting based to programming based with some level of interactivity over the recent years. This year he will be looking into how a game like environment can be displayed in different ways to represent different genres.</p>
